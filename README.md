# CodeDroidAI
Generate code and forms with AI for Delphi Object Pascal using LLMs like ChatGPT and Vicuna-13b.

The CodeDroidAI Desktop client is a powerful UI for generate code and forms for Delphi and C++Builder. Comes with the ability to verify Delphi and C++ code by compiling it and then reporting errors back to ChatGPT. Also supports other LLMs like Vicuna-13b. 
Includes a built in template system to add additional code generation options.

Built in functionality includes:
* Generate Procedures
* Code Analysis
* Comment Code
* Generate A FMX Form
* Convert Delphi Code To Borland C++
* Upgrade Delphi ANSI Code To Unicode
* Generate A VCL Form
* Convert A VCL Form To FMX
* Convert FPC Code To Delphi
* Convert Delphi Code To Inline ASM
* Optimize Code
* Translate Between Languages

Built with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/) using the FireMonkey framework this client works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (and maybe Android+iOS) with a single codebase and single UI. At the moment it is specifically set up for Windows.

It features a REST integration with OpenAI.com (ChatGPT) and Replicate.com for providing source code generation functionality within the client. You need to sign up for API keys to access that functionality.
